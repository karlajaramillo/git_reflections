Git is a part of GitHub
Clone operates with remote
When you push or pull operates on branches, taken a branch an push or pull to/from the origin or remote repository.


Steps to add a remote repository on GitHub
1- on GitHub create a new repository

2- copy the url given by Github

3- make sure there are no remote repos in your local
>>git remote     - list remote repositories

4- add the remote repository name, it is usually “origin”, and the url you picked in step 2.
>>git remote add origin url_git   

5- make sure you have created the remote repo, -v is verbose for more info
>>git remote -v 

To list all branches: 
>>git branches -a

6- send or push changes to the remote use the command git push. It takes two arguments, the remote I want to send changes to (in this case I named it “origin”), and the name of the local branch that I’d like to push 
>>git push origin master
//this means: send changes to the remote branch I created “origin” (step 4), from my local branch “master”

7- to pull the latest version of the remote repo, you’ll need to pull changes from origin to your master
>>git pull origin master
//this means: pull or obtain the remote version “origin” into my local version “master”

———————————   Reflections   ———————————

1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When we’re sharing our work with my coworkers or doing an online project, and also make sure there is an online backup.

2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To make sure you have the latest version of the remote repository.

3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

4 - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

5 - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

6 - When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
